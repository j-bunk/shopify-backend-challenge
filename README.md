## üìí Description

A scalable and modern TypeScript image repository back-end application developed following best practices using NestJS, Node.js and TypeScript. Notable features include authentication, authorization, image upload, bulk image upload, image deletion, search + more! Follow the Development section to get started and then navigate to the [SwaggerUI](http://localhost:3000/api/).

## ü•û Tech Stack

The application was created with:

- Created with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications
- Developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database
- Used [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) to interact with the database
- User authentication built using [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org) middleware
- Passwords encrypted/hashed using [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) package
- Incoming data validated using the [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) package

## üí° Project Overview

- Implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms (different users cannot access and delete each others images)
- Guarded endpoints for authorized users using Guards
- Implemented data validation using Pipes
- Implemented password encryption
- Built image upload functionality (individually or in bulk)
- Added ability to delete images
- Added ability to search image based on image's title, description or filename it was uploaded with
- Added SwaggerUI to to visualize APIs and make it easier to interact with them

## üöÄ Development

To get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/j-bunk/shopify-backend-challenge.git
cd shopify-backend-challenge
npm install
npm run start
```

SwaggerUI has been set up to make it easier to communicate with the application. Go to http://localhost:3000/api/ to interact with the APIs. Use the `/auth/signup` endpoint to create a user, then sign in with the `/auth/signin` endpoint which will return a JWT access token. Add the JWT token by clicking the Authorize button above the Images section and pasting the access token. This would give full access to the Images APIs. Upload some images using the `images/upload` endpoint or `images/bulkupload` and view them using the GET APIs (will return actual image)

_Please note that a local database would need to be set up and configured to use full functionality._

### üìÅ Project Structure

The project is split into the following parts:

- `/src` contains most of the code:
  - `/auth` contains code relating to user authentication.
  - `/config` contains configuration file to connect ORM and datbase.
  - `/images` contains code relating to image management.
- `/uploads/images` folder will be generated when an image is uploaded. Contains all uploaded images

## üîÆ Future Features

- Improve Swagger API documentation (add clearer API responses and API parameters)
- Achieve 100% testing code coverage
